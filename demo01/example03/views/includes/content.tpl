        <p>We use any feature from <a href='http://www.smarty.net/' target='_blank'>Smarty</a>, like includes.</p>
	<p>We have also used two context vars( look at /views/includes/header.tpl  ) in logo link: {literal}{#COMPONENT#} y {#RESPONSE#}{/literal}. There are much more( we will see in demo02 ). <br />
	Component is  the directory in our GUI. Response is the method that responds</p>
        <p>Step by step, we are nearby to
